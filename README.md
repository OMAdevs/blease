# Problem
The voting systems used in most developing countries, including Nigeria are inefficient and very expensive. Most times, they don't indicate the true representative of the citizens. Citizen's safety is very paramount in any country and can only be enforced by a true leader  and representative of the citizens in a democratic political system like Nigeria.  

# Proposed Solution

A tool that could transform present day democratic elections into an efficient and effective digital age democracy. A voting technology that enables fair and just election in countries and organizations.

# Proposed Stack

Node, ReactJs, Solidity, GraphQL and MongoDB

# Benefit

- To provide fairness and transparency in voting systems by enabling remote and instantaneous voting within any country or organization using publicly-verifiable blockchain technology.
- Bridging the gap between today's societies and outdates voting systems.
- To provide safety for citizens and electoral bodies during elections.
